Rock paper scissors

This project is about the classical rock-paper-scissor game and in this case, the user plays against the computer and can see if there is a winn, loose or draw and this can be repeated three times.

I started with a wireframe  but had other emojs to start with,you can see them in the wireframe but those images where not consistent when changing sizes.

## Running Tests

I had the HTML tested in Validator and there. No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C for CSS. JSHint suggests that I change Javascript version, but I choose to stick to the one that have since it is functioning for this project.

No unfixed bugs left.

The test in Lighthouse that showed acceptable results. Since I only did one test that was acceptable, I just have those results:

The website had been tested with good results for responsiveness in those different media screens: Nest Hub Max, Samsung Galaxy A1/71, IPad Mini, IPhone Pro12, IPhone SE and you can see it in the mockups here:

## Credentials

I have borrowed some codes from KristianM72 rock-paper-scissors, whos work I found in Github, but I mostly borrowed the codes from Ania Kubów´s "3 ways to code Rock Paper Scissors in JavaScript(Beginner to intermediate to Advanced!) on Youtube where I choosed the beginners level.
