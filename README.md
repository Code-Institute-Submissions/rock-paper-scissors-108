Rock paper scissors

This project is about the classical rock-paper-scissor game and in this case, the user plays against the computer and can see if there is a winn, loose or draw and this can be repeated until one of those two accumulates 5 points and at least one point over the other player since there is no winn when it is a draw. The computer keep counting and when there is a winner, the computer invites the user to start the game all over again.

I started with a wireframe  but had other emojs to start with,you can see them in the wireframe but those images where not consistent when changing sizes and the project had kept evolving, but in this image one can see the basic of it still.

## Features
This is how the site looks like before the user starts to play.

This is how it looks like when it is a draw between the user and the computer.

This is how it looks like when the computer winns against the user. In this ocasion, it is because the computer had played with a scissor and the user had played with paper. Here it is possible to see that the game invites the user to start the game once more.

This is how it looks like when the user winns against the computer.

This is how it looks like during the game when the computer is leading.

And this is how it looks like when the user is getting ahead during the game.

I would like to be be able to show all the different features that the game is capable of, but then it would bee far to many images to show. Hopfully you can imagen the rest of the situations

## Running Tests!

I had the HTML tested in Validator and there. No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C for CSS. JSHint suggests that I change Javascript version, but I choose to stick to the one that have since it is functioning for this project.

There are 2 bugs that must be left unattended. Two of them in HTML, line 22, column 5 until line 22, column 8, where there is a header: <h5> with no visible content, but that headline keeps the results up, and the second bug in html is in line 25, column 13 until line 25, column 35, where a header <h3> containing an id of the winner of five scores is proclaimed and that box would not been uphold on place without it.

The test in Lighthouse that showed acceptable results. Since I only did one test that was acceptable, I just have those results:

The website had been tested with good results for responsiveness in those different media screens: Nest Hub Max, Samsung Galaxy A1/71, IPad Mini, IPhone Pro12, IPhone SE and you can see it in the mockups here:
