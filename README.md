 Rock Paper Scissors About this project This project is about the classical rock-paper-scissor game and in this case, the user plays against the computer and can see the scores right after the selection the user makes. The page will count the points and will add and accumulate points as far as the user continues to play.

Wireframes I used Balsamiq to create wireframes to design and organize the structure of the site.
